Mogon (LSF)
==========

After compiling and copying scavenger to mogon (see README.md in the root directory). Run the following commands from this (*scavenger/mogonJobScripts/*) directory :

```    
../seed
```

Open a new Command window (in the same directory) and run :

```
<DirectoryName>/runJobs
```

<DirectoryName> should be replace with, for example, *Clustering_IrisExample* or *Sudoku*.

Note : The scavenger.conf in this directory contains the IP address for running on mogon. This should be edited depending on which login node you are on.
