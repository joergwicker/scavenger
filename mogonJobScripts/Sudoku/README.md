Running Sudoku on mogon 
======================

After compiling and copying scavenger to mogon (see README.md in the root directory). Run the following commands from this (scavenger/mogonJobScripts/Sudoku) directory :

```    
./seed
```

Open a new Command window (in the same directory) and run :

```
./runJobs
```

Note : The scavenger.conf in this directory has the correct IP address for running on mogon.
